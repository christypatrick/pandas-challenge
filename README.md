Observations:
*Top performing schools are charter schools and have higher math and reading scores over district schools.  As a result, the percent passing is higher at charter schools.  The lower performing schools are district schools with a large number of students (over 2000 students)
*The $585 â€“ 629 spending range results in a higher math score, but the spending less than $584 results in a higher reading score.  The range of spend less than $584 has the highest percentage of students passing math and reading.  This indicates that more money spent per student does not result in higher scores or passing percentages.
*Large schools (over 2000) have the lowest math and reading scores as well as the lowest amount of students passing reading and math.  The small and medium schools have the highest passing rates.
*The higher performing schools appear to do well in both math and reading.  The lower performing schools have a much lower math passing rate than reading.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
Your final report should include each of the following:

District Summary

Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

Total Schools
Total Students
Total Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)




School Summary

Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)




Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include:

School Name
School Type
Total Students
Total School Budget
Per Student Budget
Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)




Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include all of the same metrics as above.


Math Scores by Grade**

Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


Reading Scores by Grade

Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


Scores by School Spending

Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:

Average Math Score
Average Reading Score
% Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
% Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
% Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)




Scores by School Size

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).


Scores by School Type

Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).
